# Time-Series-Analysis-Google-Web-Traffic-Analysis

Time series predictions are extensively used in the business decisions by analysing the past user behaviour or historical pattern of events which can come handy in making a better future decisions. It has a wide variety of applications such as Stock Market predictions, Economic Predictions, Census Analysis and Inventory Planning.

This project is focused on predicting the future values of the Google web traffic. It is considered as challenging to forecast the future value of the time series data for web traffic because of the unpredictability of the factors contributing to the websiteâ€™s traffic. 

The data that I have chosen to work on is the Wikipedia web traffic data. This data analysis is focused on the factors contributing to the wikipedia web traffic like the day, duration, holidays, weekends and any other major events like elections and Olympics. And later in the project I have explored on the multiple algorithms which can work well with forecast of the time series data.
